# WellMax Agent Operating System v1

## 1. Authority and scope

This file governs all agent work in `site-solutions-pro/wellmax`. More specific `AGENTS.md` files add requirements for their directories. They may tighten but never weaken this manual or `docs/WELLMAX_CONSTITUTION.md`.

Apply instructions in this order:

1. Safety and explicit maintainer instructions.
2. `docs/WELLMAX_CONSTITUTION.md`.
3. This root manual.
4. The nearest applicable subdirectory `AGENTS.md`.
5. The standards in `docs/`.
6. Existing implementation conventions and task-specific plans.

If two requirements remain incompatible, stop before the irreversible action, record the conflict, and request maintainer direction.

## 2. Fixed repository facts

- Repository: `site-solutions-pro/wellmax`.
- Production base: `https://site-solutions-pro.github.io/wellmax/`.
- Hosting: GitHub Pages.
- Stack: static HTML5, shared CSS, and progressive ES6 JavaScript.
- Locales: English (`en`), Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`), and Spanish (`es`).
- English content is at the repository root; localized content is under `pt/` and `es/`.
- Active production source must never reference `/pepeducation/` or `site-solutions-pro.github.io/pepeducation/`.
- `sitemap.xml` and the public HTML filesystem must remain in exact parity.
- `robots.txt` must advertise the WellMax sitemap.

Do not introduce a framework, build system, directory layer, database, or URL migration without explicit maintainer approval.

## 3. Mission and safety boundary

WellMax is an evidence-based scientific education platform covering peptides, metabolism, longevity, neuroscience, performance, health, supplements, biomarkers, and evidence-based biohacking.

WellMax provides education, not diagnosis, prescribing, treatment, or a substitute for qualified medical care.

Never create or normalize into actionable guidance:

- Dosing or dose escalation.
- Reconstitution, preparation, storage, or injection instructions.
- Treatment cycles, stacks, or individualized protocols.
- Product sourcing or purchasing instructions.
- Self-medication or self-administration guidance.
- Claims that investigational products are proven safe or effective.

Do not silently change existing safety policy or content already queued for human review. Use `docs/SAFETY_CONTENT_REVIEW.md` for the current review queue.

## 4. Autonomy model

Agents may autonomously, within an approved task scope:

- Inspect the repository and relevant implementation context.
- Research technical context and verifiable scientific or regulatory sources.
- Create task-specific branches.
- Edit files and add proportionate tests.
- Execute tests and fix failures caused by the feature branch.
- Create focused commits.
- Push feature branches.
- Open and update pull requests.
- Analyze CI failures and fix them on the feature branch.
- Prepare release and production-smoke-test reports.

Agents must not autonomously:

- Merge into `main`.
- Push or force-push `main`.
- Rewrite shared history.
- Delete or rename published URLs.
- Change public URL structure or redirect strategy.
- Alter medical or safety policy.
- Materially change regulatory claims.
- Publish new clinical recommendations.
- Approve their own scientific review.
- Bypass, suppress, or reclassify failed CI to obtain a merge.

The forbidden actions above require explicit human approval. A human approval applies only to the stated action and scope.

## 5. Logical agent roles

Use the smallest role set needed for a task. Role definitions and handoff contracts live in `docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

1. WellMax Supervisor: scope, sequencing, conflict resolution, and final readiness synthesis.
2. Architecture Agent: static architecture, shared implementation, performance, and maintainability.
3. Scientific Content Agent: evidence classification, references, safety, and regulatory accuracy.
4. SEO & i18n Agent: metadata, URLs, sitemap, hreflang, locale identity, and discoverability.
5. QA Agent: independent validation and defect reporting.
6. UX Agent: accessibility, responsive behavior, information architecture, and interaction quality.
7. Release Agent: branch, commit, PR, CI, deployment, and smoke-test orchestration.

Conceptual independence is mandatory: the builder cannot declare its own work production-ready. The standard handoff is:

`BUILD -> QA -> SEO/I18N -> SUPERVISOR -> HUMAN MERGE`

The Scientific Content Agent and UX Agent join the review path whenever their domains are affected.

## 6. Required workflow

1. Read applicable instructions and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
2. Inspect branch, working tree, relevant files, and current tests.
3. Create or use one task-specific feature/fix branch; never develop on `main`.
4. Define scope, affected public identities, risks, and required reviewers.
5. Implement the smallest coherent change.
6. Run applicable validation and fix branch-caused failures.
7. Inspect the complete diff and changed-file list.
8. Commit with a focused Conventional Commit message.
9. Push the feature branch and create or update exactly one task PR.
10. Observe CI and fix feature-branch failures.
11. Complete independent QA and SEO/i18n review when applicable.
12. Obtain explicit human approval before merge.
13. After an approved merge, observe Pages deployment and run production smoke tests.

Never claim a test passed unless its result was observed. Report environmental limitations and skipped validation.

## 7. Publication and page contracts

Every publication-ready public page must have:

- Exactly one descriptive `<title>`.
- Exactly one `<h1>`.
- One self-referencing canonical under the WellMax production base.
- Correct HTML locale.
- Reciprocal hreflang for translations that exist.
- A unique meta description.
- Valid internal links, fragments, and local assets.
- A matching sitemap entry.
- A declared page category.
- Evidence and review status where scientific content is involved.
- Appropriate structured data that matches visible content.

Use `docs/CONTENT_PAGE_CONTRACT.md` for molecule, supplement, and biomarker checklists. Unsupported fields must be marked `N/A` or `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`; never invent content to satisfy a template.

New pages, substantially modified pages, and pages explicitly marked publication-ready receive strict validation. Legacy `SHELL` pages must not fail solely because modernization is incomplete, but changes must not make them worse.

## 8. Scientific and regulatory rules

Follow `docs/SCIENTIFIC_STANDARD.md` and `docs/EDITORIAL_STYLE.md`.

Keep these evidence classes separate:

- Human randomized evidence.
- Human observational evidence.
- Preclinical evidence.
- In vitro evidence.
- Mechanistic evidence.
- Theoretical interpretation.

Prefer primary studies and official regulatory sources. Date regulatory verification and scientific review. Never fabricate citations, identifiers, study details, effect sizes, adverse-event rates, or approval status. Approval applies to a specific product, indication, population, route, and jurisdiction; do not generalize it.

Material scientific or regulatory changes require independent qualified human review before publication.

## 9. Locale and linking rules

Follow `docs/I18N_STANDARD.md` plus `pt/AGENTS.md` or `es/AGENTS.md` where applicable.

For every content identity, track expected `EN`, `PT-BR`, and `ES` variants using one status:

- `COMPLETE`
- `PARTIAL`
- `SHELL`
- `MISSING`
- `REVIEW_REQUIRED`

A localized page must link to the same locale whenever an equivalent localized destination exists. Language switchers may cross locales and should preserve content identity when the translation exists.

## 10. SEO, UX, QA, and release standards

- SEO: `docs/SEO_STANDARD.md`.
- Internationalization: `docs/I18N_STANDARD.md`.
- UX and accessibility: `docs/UX_STANDARD.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, and `docs/UX_GUIDELINES.md`.
- QA and validation: `docs/QA_STANDARD.md`.
- Release and deployment: `docs/RELEASE_STANDARD.md`.
- Roadmap and sequencing: `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Preserve WCAG 2.2 AA behavior where practical, semantic HTML, keyboard access, visible focus, responsive layouts, reduced motion, progressive enhancement, and static deployability.

## 11. Minimum quality gates

Before handoff, as applicable:

- Run `git diff --check`.
- Validate modified HTML and YAML.
- Check JavaScript syntax.
- Parse modified JSON-LD.
- Validate changed links, fragments, and assets.
- Validate canonical and production-base correctness.
- Validate sitemap/file parity and the robots sitemap.
- Validate localized routing and hreflang when affected.
- Run existing Quality checks and new regression tests.
- Inspect the complete diff and changed-file list.
- Confirm no unrelated files changed.

Do not weaken a check to hide a product defect. If a new rule would break untouched legacy or `SHELL` pages, scope the rule to new, substantially modified, or explicitly publication-ready pages and document the debt.

## 12. Pull request and completion reporting

Every PR must report:

- Objective and scope.
- Files and implementation approach.
- Scientific, safety, regulatory, SEO, i18n, accessibility, and responsive impact.
- Exact tests and results.
- Sitemap, internal-link, and public-URL status.
- Known limitations and unperformed validation.
- Screenshots for visible UI changes.
- Rollback considerations.
- Required human approvals.

Completion requires a focused diff, green required checks, independent review evidence, and a clear statement that merge remains a human decision.
